Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.

RT @tsrandall: Tesla’s Autopilot vindicated in NHTSA probe that shows a 40% drop in crashes https://t.co/u6ouLjaYnf https://t.co/BETOhKq8lv
@TOCHOTE Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
@cameronrad Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
@ModularLifeSys @NHTSAgov It might. Am not sure.
@gavinnwaters Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”
Final report on Autopilot issued by @NHTSAgov is very positive https://t.co/KsOZSrr3l9

@brandonr182 @sama Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
@MotorTrend Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is
@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.
@robsmallshire @ClareMacraeUK It will
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...

@darkdude203 It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter.
@CMaggiore50 Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer.
