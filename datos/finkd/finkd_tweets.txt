Tell your congressmen you want them to be pro-internet. My Facebook post is here: https://t.co/XEmFNxGt
Also just created a public page on FB: www.facebook.com/markzuckerberg
Excited about rolling out the new real-time stream home page to all FB. To everyone who has written in asking for it, you'll have it soon!
I find it funny that it's on Digg that I'm here. I'm looking forward to when people can have unlimited connections on Facebook soon!
So many interesting people are following me. I think I'll follow some of you guys as well.
Yes, this is the real Mark Zuckerberg. Thanks for following me!
@mikebrophy I agree.
@playrob We'll start rolling it out next week.
A good day.

@johnmccrea hey, how'd you find this account? I know it's not private but I'm just curious. Also, I'm enjoying socialwebtv.
Never thought I'd be on a boat.
@ooontz I knew you'd be under ditka
